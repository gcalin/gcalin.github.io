# Welcome!

I am a M.Sc. student following the Artificial Intelligence Technology track of the Computer Science Programme at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. I am interested in topics from a wide range of domains, including Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, and Scientific Computation. 

Originally from Bucharest, Romania, I moved to The Netherlands in 2018 to pursue an education and career in the field of Computer Science. Since then, I have been part of numerous exciting projects centered around research and teaching. Interested in collaborating? Reach out!
